# fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz in as many languages as I can manage. All written by me and Sami Husain.

They all currently use a similar algorithm, except the Erlang, Elixir, and Haskell ones.

I'll favour quick, na√Øve implementations at first, then expand my collection to include more generalised examples. My aim is to display the character of each language in an idiomatic simple piece of code.

Requests [here](https://github.com/kmoe/fizzbuzz/issues).
