# fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz in as many languages as I can manage. All written by me.

They all currently use a similar algorithm, except the Erlang, Elixir, and Haskell ones.

I'll favour quick, na√Øve implementations at first, then expand my collection to include more generalised examples. My aim is to display the character of each language in an idiomatic simple piece of code.
