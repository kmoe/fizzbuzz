# fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz in many languages. Each written by [Katy Moe](https://github.com/kmoe) or [Sami Husain](https://github.com/samiwh). We are not currently accepting contributions, except bugfixes.

Our aim is to display the character of each language in an idiomatic, simple piece of code.

Requests [here](https://github.com/kmoe/fizzbuzz/issues).
